# Embracing Kubernetes - Cloud Native Applications

*Getting started with containerization*

## Introduction

Nowadays cloud technologies have become the *State of the Art* in the technology sector. This is a natural change due to on-premise infrastructure ending up being cumbersome to manage and companies needing teams just involved in guaranteeing a certain level of stability of the production environments (rather than the applications).

The adoption of cloud services enables some key factors infrastructure-wise, from which we can highlight the following:
* Flexibility: __easily manage__ different services based on demand.
* Scalability: __easily deliver__ quality solutions to a flowing amount of users.

Now the question is, why don't we also apply this mindset to our applications? Thanks to container services such as Docker we can also grant our application with the same benefits:
* **Flexibility**: converting it into smaller and isolated components that we can treat as independent building blocks.
* **Scalability**: as we are capable of adding more computing units in those parts that tend to become bottlenecks.

If, on top of that we add the capabilites of the **DevOps** philosophy, we will be creating an environment where we can continuosly deliver value as we speed up internal processes by closing the gap between Development and Operations.
